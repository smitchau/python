#Write a Python program to convert a list of characters into a string.

list1 = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 's', 'm', 'i', 't']  # List containing characters

# Loop through each element (character) in list1
for i in list1:
    print(i, end="")  # Print each character without a newline, using end="" to concatenate the characters

# This code prints each character in list1 without separating them by a newline.
