Built-in Functions:

    These functions are part of the Python language and are available for use without
    requiring any import.
    Examples include print(), len(), max(), min(), type(), etc.

User-defined Functions:
    These functions are created by users as needed to perform specific tasks.
    Users can define their functions using the def keyword and utilize them
    throughout their program.

Anonymous Functions (Lambda Functions):
    These are small, unnamed functions that can be defined using the lambda keyword.
    They are primarily used where a function is required for a short period and
    aren't required to be named.
