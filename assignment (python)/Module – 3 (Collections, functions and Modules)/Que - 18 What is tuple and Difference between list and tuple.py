18] What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.

-> A tuple is a collection of Python objects that is ordered and immutable.
   This means that the order of elements in a tuple cannot be changed,and
   elements cannot be added,removed, or replaced.
   Tuples are created using parentheses and elements are separated by commas.

 * Difference between list and tuple ?
 -> list                                        -> tuple
 -> List are mutable                            -> Tuples are immutable
 -> Created using square brackets ([])          -> Created using parentheses (())
 -> Lists have several built-in methods.        -> A tuple does not have many built-in methods
                                                   because of immutability
