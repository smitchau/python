    def make_sound(self):
        pass

# Child class (subclass) inheriting from Animal
class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

# Child class (subclass) inheriting from Animal
class Cat(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Meow!"

# Creating instances of the subclasses
dog = Dog("Canine")
cat = Cat("Feline")

# Accessing superclass attributes and methods through subclasses
print(dog.species)  # Accessing the 'species' attribute from the Animal class
print(cat.species)

print(dog.make_sound())  # Using the 'make_sound' method from the Animal class
print(cat.make_sound())
